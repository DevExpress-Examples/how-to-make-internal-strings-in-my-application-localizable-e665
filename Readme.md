# How to make internal strings in my application localizable


<p>This example doesn't use DevExpress components, only standard ones. It demonstrates how to add a resource file to your application, make a localized copy of it, and read message strings from the resource.</p><p>The sample supports two languages: English and French. If you use Microsoft Windows with French UI, the test application displays French messages when launched. Otherwise, it displays English messages.</p><p>To translate messages into another language, make a copy of UserMessages.resx, rename it according to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sb6a8618.aspx">Resource Naming Conventions</a>, open it, and edit resource strings.</p>
